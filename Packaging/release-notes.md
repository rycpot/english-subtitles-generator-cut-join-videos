Three tools for movies on your Mac: English subtitles for foreign-language films (`Movie.srt`, saved next to the movie, via Groq's free Whisper API), a frame-exact Cutter/Splitter, and a Joiner. For macOS 12 Monterey or later, Intel Macs.

**Install**
1. Download `EnglishSubtitlesGenerator-CutJoinVideos-macOS.zip` below and unzip it.
2. Drag **English Subtitles Generator, Cut & Join Videos.app** into Applications.
3. First launch: right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**. If macOS still refuses, run this in Terminal:
   `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/English Subtitles Generator, Cut & Join Videos.app"`
4. Paste your free Groq API key (from https://console.groq.com/keys) into the box at the top, then drop a movie on the window.

**What's in this version**
- **Cut parts keep the exact frame rate:** a cut that started between two frames left a tiny timing gap, and .mp4 output couldn't store 23.976 fps exactly, so a part could show e.g. 24.083 fps and the Joiner wanted to convert two halves of the same film. Cuts now start and end exactly on frames and keep the source's frame rate, so their parts join back without conversion.
- The Joiner compares frame rates by value, so the same rate always matches however it is written.

Parts cut with v1.5.3 or earlier may carry the wrong frame rate; cut them again before joining.

Earlier: quick cut for open-GOP films and trailers (v1.5.3); separate logs per tab and Clear Log (v1.5.2); new name (v1.5.1); Cutter and Joiner tabs, smart cut, cleaner subtitles (v1.5.0); charcoal and green theme (v1.4.0); whisper-large-v3 only (v1.3.1); long films wait out Groq's hourly limit (v1.3.0); audio track picker (v1.1.0); 30-second parts for sync, `Movie.srt` naming (v1.0.0).
