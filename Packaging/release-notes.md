Three tools for movies on your Mac: English subtitles for foreign-language films (`Movie.srt`, saved next to the movie, via Groq's free Whisper API), a frame-exact Cutter/Splitter, and a Joiner. For macOS 12 Monterey or later, Intel Macs.

**Install**
1. Download `EnglishSubtitlesGenerator-CutJoinVideos-macOS.zip` below and unzip it.
2. Drag **English Subtitles Generator, Cut & Join Videos.app** into Applications.
3. First launch: right-click the app → **Open** → **Open**. If macOS still refuses, run this in Terminal:
   `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/English Subtitles Generator, Cut & Join Videos.app"`
4. Paste your free Groq API key (from https://console.groq.com/keys) into the box at the top, then drop a movie on the window.

**What's in this version**
- **Faster, lossless cuts of films and trailers:** many are encoded with "open GOP", which made the Cutter's quick cut fail its join check (e.g. `reference count 1 overflow`) and redo the whole range with full re-encoding. Those files now use the quick cut: the middle is copied untouched and only a few frames at each end are re-encoded.
- The join check no longer mistakes the source's own open-GOP decoding messages for a bad join.
- The app now includes the FFmpeg licence notice (`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`).
